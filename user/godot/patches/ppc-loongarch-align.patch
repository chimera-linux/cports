    powerpc, loongarch: make DVECTOR_ALIGNMENT same as VECTOR_ALIGNMENT
    
    It makes no sense to make dvector alignment less. For example,
    DMat44 uses DVECTOR_ALIGNMENT but contains an array of 3 Vec4
    which uses VECTOR_ALIGNMENT. That means DMat44 must be at least
    as aligned as Vec4.
