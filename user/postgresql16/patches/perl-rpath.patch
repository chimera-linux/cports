We configure Postgres with --disable-rpath because for the most part we
want to leave it to ldconfig to determine where libraries are.  However,
for some reason the Perl package puts libperl.so in a nonstandard place
and doesn't add that place to the ldconfig search path.  I think this
is a Perl packaging bug, myself, but apparently it's not going to change.
So work around it by adding an rpath spec to plperl.so (only).
