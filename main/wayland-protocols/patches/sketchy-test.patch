Subject: [PATCH] disable failing test

The xdg-decoration-unstable-v1 test is wonky. Apparently the
scanner generates a reference to xdg_toplevel_interface in the
code but no actual structure definition, resulting in an undefined
symbol.

Oddly enough, this fails in some of my environments and does not
in others (it fails in some of my Void setups too). It does not
seem to be affected by musl.
