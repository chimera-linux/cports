[externally-managed]
Error=
 This Python installation is managed by apk, and installation of additional
 modules managed outside of apk is discouraged. Please consider using a
 virtual environment (venv) instead, for example like this:

   python -m venv --system-site-packages /path/to/venv
   . /path/to/venv/bin/activate

 This will give you a shell in the virtual environment. To deactivate the
 venv, run the following:

   deactivate

 You can also run pip as well as other commands installed in the venv without
 activating it, by invoking them by their full path.
