Subject: [PATCH 1/3] libtracefs utest: Add PATH_MAX if it is not already
 defined

In some setups PATH_MAX may not be defined (it is usually defined in
linux/limits.h), but we just use PATH_MAX as something to hold the paths
to the tracing files. In that case, just define it to 1024 if it's not
already defined.
