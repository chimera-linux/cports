NEVER EVER REMOVE THIS PATCH
REBASE IT ON TOP OF THE VERSION YOU'RE UPGRADING

This makes certifi use the system certificates instead of the ones
provided with certifi instead, this allows us to add this package as a
dependency for other packages without worries.

This is based on the patch used by Alpine, which in turn is based on the
patch used by Debian.
