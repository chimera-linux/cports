Description: fix renamed LV detection
  It looks like the detection of the LVM logical volumes fails in
  certain edge conditions. In particular, it was reported that
  renaming an LV will make grub fail to boot from the system as it
  cannot properly detect it anymore.
  .
  I have looked at the code surrounding the patch and cannot claim to
  understand the entire function here, as it is huge and quite
  cryptic. But it seems sane: the `ptr` we're inspecting here starts
  at the `rlocn->offset`, but we were adding `mda_size` to the
  (somewhat) unrelated metadatabuf instead. Now we're marking the
  `mda_end` correctly, based on the rlocn->offsite and ->size.
  .
  I have not tested this myself as the test setup is quite involved,
  but it seems others (e.g. "Hoyer, David" <David.Hoyer@netapp.com>)
  have tested the patch and confirmed it worked.
