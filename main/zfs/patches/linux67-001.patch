Subject: [PATCH] linux 6.7 compat: simplify current_time() check

6.7 changed the names of the time members in struct inode, so we can't
assign back to it because we don't know its name. In practice this
doesn't matter though - if we're missing current_time(), then we must be
on <4.9, and we know our fallback will need to return timespec.
